Welcome to **Greate: Beyond The Horizon**, an immersive Minecraft modpack that combines the best of Create, GregTech, and more! This modpack is currently in the early stages of development.

## Lore ðŸ“œ

In a galaxy far away, the people of a technologically advanced planet found their home teetering on the brink of destruction. The sacred balance between the innovative **Create Engineers** and the hardcore **GregTech Technicians** was shattered by extremist factions, igniting a hundred-year war that left their world in ruins. Now, a brave soul must venture beyond the horizon, restore the balance, and find a new home for the survivors, the people of Gregoria Prime.

## Features ðŸŽ®

* **Heavy Integration**: Create and GregTech are seamlessly integrated, providing a unique and challenging experience.

* **Custom Components & Tier System**: The Create mod has been expanded with many custom components and an expert-tier system.

* **Hardcore GregTech**: The GregTech mod is here in all its glory for the most demanding tech players.

* **Magic, Logistics & More**: Additional mods like Thaumcraft, Applied Energistics 2, and many more provide diversity and added fun.
