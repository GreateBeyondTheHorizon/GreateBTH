💫 First off, **thank you** for considering contributing to _Greate: Beyond The Horizon_! It's people like you that make this project such a great modpack.

## 🐞 How Can I Contribute?

1. **Reporting Bugs**🔍: If you've discovered a bug, please create a new issue on our GitHub repo describing the problem and where it occurred.

2. **Suggesting Enhancements**💡: If you have a new idea for the modpack, we'd love to hear about it! Please create a new issue on our GitHub repo describing your suggestion.

3. **Pull Requests**📤: If you've developed a bug fix or improvement for the modpack, please submit a pull request! Before making a pull request, please ensure the modpack still works with your changes.

### Setting up your local environment
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the latest build of the pack from [latest-dev](https://github.com/GreateBeyondTheHorizon/GreateBTH/releases/tag/latest-dev).
3. Import the pack into your Minecraft launcher of choice.
4. You're now free to change files or add mods in the instance folder that was created in step 3 after importing.
5. To commit your changes, copy your edits in the instance folder to the folder in which you cloned this repository.

**NOTE:** When updating your local repo from `master`, make sure your instance has the same mod versions as the repository, as mod versions might have been changed. It is often faster (and less error prone) to make a new instance from `latest-dev` than it is to check for mod version differences.
